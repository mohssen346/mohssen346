## About Me
I am a researcher and developer specializing in **Remote Sensing**, **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** and **Python** programming. My work focuses on extracting insights from geospatial data and implementing solutions using tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and other modern data-science ecosystems.

- 🔭 Currently working on: Geospatial analytics, remote sensing research and building open-source projects that integrate GIS workflows with Python.  
- 🌱 Currently learning: Advanced machine-learning models for spatial data, cloud-native geoprocessing and scalable mapping solutions.  
- 💬 Ask me about: Remote sensing techniques, GIS data pipelines, Python automation, Earth Engine scripting.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsen-forouzandeh/) (Feel free to connect!)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe that mapping the Earth is just the beginning — extracting meaning from those maps is where things get really interesting.

## Skills & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python (including libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy), SQL, JavaScript (for Earth Engine).  
- **GIS & Remote Sensing:** Raster and vector analysis, satellite image processing, classification, change detection, spatial modelling.  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL/OGR, remote-sensing toolkits.  
- **Data & Analytics:** Geospatial databases, spatial data visualization, mapping dashboards, remote‐sensing spectral indices.  
- **DevOps & Collaboration:** Git, GitHub workflows, open-source contribution, documentation, version control.

## Projects & Highlights
Here are a few key highlights and sample projects demonstrating my experience in remote sensing and GIS:

- Developed a Python-based workflow to ingest, preprocess and analyse large satellite imagery datasets (e.g., Sentinel, Landsat) for land-cover change detection.  
- Built interactive maps and dashboards to visualise spatial patterns related to environmental monitoring and urban development.  
- Implemented classification algorithms in Earth Engine to extract land-use classes and assess changes over time.  
- Collaborated on interdisciplinary research linking spatial data to societal topics such as health equity, environmental justice and spatial accessibility.

*(Stay tuned for more open-source repositories coming soon.)*

## How I Work
- I follow a reproducible-science mindset: documentation, modular code, clear versioning and transparent results.  
- I believe in the open-data and open-source movement: wherever possible I share code, tutorials and data-processing workflows to benefit the community.  
- I engage with peers and researchers: I value peer review, collaboration and continuous learning.

## Let’s Connect
If you share interests in remote sensing, GIS, geospatial analytics or Python development — I’d love to connect and explore ways to collaborate. Whether it’s a research project, an open-source initiative or a professional opportunity — drop me a message on LinkedIn or open an issue/PR in one of my repositories.
